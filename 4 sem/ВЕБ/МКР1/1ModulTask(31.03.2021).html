                The universe (Latin: universus) is all of space and time[a] and their contents,[10] 
                including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy. 
                The Big Bang theory is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the 
                universe. According to estimation of this theory, space and time emerged together 
                13.799±0.021 billion years ago,[2] and the universe has been expanding ever since. While 
                the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,[3] it is possible to measure the size 
                of the observable universe, which is currently estimated to be 93 billion 
                light-years in diameter.

            <b>Size and regions</b><br>

            <b>Size and regions</b>The size of the universe is somewhat difficult to define. According to the general theory of relativity, far regions of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space.<br>
            <b>Age and expansion</b>Astronomers calculate the age of the universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model.<br>

            <b>Spacetime</b>Spacetimes are the arenas in which all physical events take place. The basic elements of spacetimes are events. In any given spacetime, an event is defined as a unique position at a unique time<br>

            <b>Shape</b>General relativity describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy (gravity). The topology or geometry of the universe includes both local geometry in the observable universe and global geometry.
            Composition<br>

            <b>Dark energy</b> An explanation for why the expansion of the universe is accelerating remains elusive. It is often attributed to 
            "dark energy", an unknown form of energy that is hypothesized to permeate space<br>
            On a mass–energy equivalence basis, the density of dark energy (~ 7 × 10−30 g/cm3) is much less than the density of ordinary matter or 
            dark matter within galaxies. However, in the present dark-energy era, it dominates the mass–energy of the universe because it is uniform 
            across space.[103][104]

            Two proposed forms for dark energy are the cosmological constant, a constant energy density filling space homogeneously,[105] 
            and scalar fields such as quintessence or moduli, dynamic quantities whose energy density can vary in time and space. 
            Contributions from scalar fields that are constant in space are usually also included in the cosmological constant. 
            The cosmological constant can be formulated to be equivalent to vacuum energy. Scalar fields having only a slight amount of 
            spatial inhomogeneity would be difficult to distinguish from a
            <span style="background-color : yellow">Dark matter</span>Dark matter is a hypothetical kind of matter that is invisible to the entire 
            electromagnetic spectrum, but which accounts for most of 
            the matter in the universe. The existence and properties of dark matter are inferred from its gravitational effects on visible matter, 
            radiation, and the large-scale structure of the universe.
